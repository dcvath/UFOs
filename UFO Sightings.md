# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic web page where users can filter UFO sightings data. HTML, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, and BootStrap were used to build the web page.

## Results
### Website
To perform a search, the user can type up to five different types of criterion to filter the data, including date, city, state, country, and shape.

### Perform Search
The user can perform a search by entering the search term(s) within one or multiple fields and hitting the 'enter' key and the results will populate at the bottom of the page.

## Summary
### Draw Backs
One draw back to this website is that the user can only visulize the data in table form. 

### Additional Recommendations
To address the draw back above, it would be beneficial to add a chart visualization. For example, the user could quickly glance at a bar chart with city names and number of sightings to see which city within the US has had the most or least sightings. An additional recommendation would be to create drop down menus for the city, state, and country fields. This would help the user to know what data is within the table. Currently, the user has to scroll through to see what cities are included.
